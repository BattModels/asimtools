This directory uses calculators and codes for which external programs have to be installed but are not necessary for the core features of ASIMTools. The user is responsible for installing the packages themselves. If the load for the calculator is not available, the current workaround is to submit an issue showing how to instantiate the ASE calculator. Future releases of ASIMTools will allow custom calc loaders.
